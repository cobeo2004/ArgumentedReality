# ArgumentedReality

This application is created with Swift along with SwiftUI and RealityKit library, to demonstrate the use of Augmented Reality (AR) technology. By selecting the given shape, which is Cube or Sphere, user can place, move and remove the shape using touch gesture. This project is heavily adopted from RealitySchool and extending the features by Simon Nguyen.
